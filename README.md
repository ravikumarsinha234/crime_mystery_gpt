# crime_mystery_gpt
This project try to explore the idea of the creation of the large language model for the crime mystery novelsðŸ§ŸðŸ•·ðŸ”ªðŸ‘»ðŸŽ¬. It helps to understand the world of generative AI in a much better way. How can we do more in the space of large language model and maybe try to create a better story and narative to the readers.


# Crime Mystery Story Generation using GPT-2

## Overview
A research project exploring the use of GPT-2 to generate crime mystery stories, focusing on understanding the model's ability to capture genre-specific narrative elements.

## Dataset Details
- **Source**: Hugging Face Mystery Crime Books dataset
- **Total Characters**: 562,489
- **Total Tokens**: 136,309
- **Train/Validation Split**: 90/10
- **Text Sources**: Public domain crime mystery novels, including works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

## Model Specifications
- **Model Type**: GPT-2 Small
- **Total Parameters**: 124 million
- **Vocabulary Size**: 50,257 tokens
- **Context Length**: 1,024 tokens
- **Embedding Dimension**: 768
- **Transformer Layers**: 12
- **Attention Heads**: 12

## Training Setup
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0004
- **Weight Decay**: 0.1
- **Dropout Rate**: 0.1
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Total Epochs**: 50
- **Hardware**: Nvidia T4 GPU

## Research Challenges
- Generating coherent crime mystery narratives
- Maintaining suspense and plot consistency
- Handling complex character motivations
- Overcoming limited dataset diversity


## Future Research Directions
1. Expand dataset to include more diverse crime mystery texts
2. Implement advanced decoding strategies
3. Explore reinforcement learning techniques
4. Improve narrative coherence
5. Enhance genre-specific storytelling capabilities
